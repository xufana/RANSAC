This project is an implementation of [Li, L., Yang, F., Zhu, H., Li, D., Li, Y., & Tang, L. (2017). An Improved RANSAC for 3D Point Cloud Plane Segmentation Based on Normal Distribution Transformation Cells. Remote Sensing, 9(5), 433. doi:10.3390/rs9050433](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316697320_An_Improved_RANSAC_for_3D_Point_Cloud_Plane_Segmentation_Based_on_Normal_Distribution_Transformation_Cells) as a part of the second year coursework.
